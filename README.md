# NYC Taxi Data

## Overview
The goal of this project was to develop an entire ETL Pipeline from start to finish. We chose the NYC Taxi dataset. 
We used technologies like streamlit to display our visuals, postgres to store our data, jupyter notebook to code it all, and docker.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the "proj docker" folder
2. Make changes in streamlit_app.py and Load-2.py. Update these values which currently have placeholders:
   ```python
   DB_HOST = 'localhost'
   DB_PORT = '5432'
   DB_NAME = 'taxi_data'
   DB_USER = 'postgres'
   DB_PASSWORD = 'hello'
3. Go to terminal and run "docker build -t streamlit-etl-app ."
4. Next, run "docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit-etl-app"
5. Copy ad paste the Local URL in the browser of your choice. Below is a screenshot of the streamlit dashboard and what should come up on your screen too.
